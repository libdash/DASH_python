    "#### Why So Many Imports?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python programs typically require multiple import statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason is that the core language is deliberately kept small, so that it's easy to learn, maintain and improve.\n",

    "As stated above, NumPy is a Python package.\n",

    "In fact, a **package** is just a directory containing\n",
    "\n",
    "1. files with Python code --- called **modules** in Python speak\n",
    "1. possibly some compiled code that can be accessed by Python (e.g., functions compiled from C or FORTRAN code)\n",
    "1. a file called `__init__.py` that specifies what will be executed when we type `import package_name`\n",
    "\n",
    "You can check the location of your  `__init__.py` for NumPy in python by running the code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block} ipython\n",
    ":class: no-execute\n",
